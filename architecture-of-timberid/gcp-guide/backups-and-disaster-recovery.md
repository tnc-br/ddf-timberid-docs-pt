# âš  Backups and Disaster Recovery

Disaster recover is enabled for the production firestore database for a 7 day retention period. You may also manually create backups. The storage for these options are billable, so creating more backups or increasing the retention period will increase cost.

You can see more in the [disaster recovery options](https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore/databases/-default-/disaster-recovery?authuser=0\&project=timberid-prd\&hl=en) for the production project.

If you want to access the data to restore into the current database, see [how to use the gcloud command line interface](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/use-pitr?hl=en#export\_and\_import\_from\_a\_consistent\_pitr\_version) to export firestore data from an old timestamp and then reimport.
