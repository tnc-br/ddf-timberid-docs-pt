### Organizations in TimberID

All data in TimberID is private based on the organization you belong to. This is to ensure privacy of users and the related information on the timber samples.

When you request to join an existing Organization, you are placed in a pending state. In this state, you are unable to view any Organization data. When you are approved to join an Organization (by the organization administrator), you may then both view existing sample data and enter new data.

Within an organization there are only two levels of access.

<table><thead><tr><th width="217">Role</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Organization Administrator</td><td>The 'org admin' may approve and delete users in their organization.</td></tr><tr><td>Organization Member</td><td>An Organization Member may add data to Timber ID and view all data entered by other Organization Members</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Creating a new Organization

If you wish to create a new organization, your request must be approved by a Site Administrator, as described in the [Administration Guide](administration-guide/). Once approved, you will become the organization admin of your requested Organization and be allowed to enter sample data and access that data through the TimberID Earth Engine API.



### View Data in TimberID

Once you have been approved for TimberID, you will see the main screen that shows all current timber sample data.

At the top (as indicated above) you will see timber sample data that has not been complete. Timber samples in this state may not have all measurements completed from their lab.&#x20;

The Completed sample data at the bottom shows both Reference Sample data that is entered or imported by researchers and professionals to train models, and Origin Verification sample data that is entered on seized timber samples for TimberID to perform analysis.
